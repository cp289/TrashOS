    \section*{Introduction}

    Operating systems are incredibly complicated pieces of software and very
    challenging to develop. Here process of developing \trashos is documented
    with the hope of easing the learning process for the reader.

    \section{Essential Background}

    Familiarity with the C language and the bare basics of using \verb|gcc| is
    essential. Furthermore, you must have experimented with making basic
    userspace applications in x86 assembly language and dissassembling C source
    files. The better you understand the relationship between C and the
    generated assembly code, the better.

    \section{Beginning}

    You should start by learning what object files are and what linking is.
    Then, read through the documentation of the GNU Linker. This is available on
    most linux systems via \verb|info ld|. Understanding the concepts in Section
    3 is especially important. Thankfully this is {\it really} well-documented.
