#####   BUILD PROCESS   #####

This project requires a GCC cross compiler for each target architecture.
Supported architectures are i386 and x86_64. For building an EFI bootloader, a
cross compiler for the x86_64-w64-mingw32 or x86_64-w64-mingw32 targets are
needed.

Once necessary cross compilers are installed, modify make.config as needed.
Below are the supported make.config contents.

To build i386 system:
    
    ARCH?=i386
    MARCH?=i686

To build x86_64 system:
    
    ARCH?=x86_64
    MARCH?=x86_64

Lastly, simply run `make`.
